# EEG-eyesclosed-Detection
 UCLouvain EEG analysis and eyes closed and open prediction

Python project done by Erasmus students Tom√°s dos Santos Talento and Marc Phillipe Marburger.

Two datasets with different lengths one recorded during eyes open and one recorded during eyes closed. Then mixed and blinded.
In this code and report we describe the development and testing of several ML models including the basic data preprocessing, to have the best possible predictions of eye condition.
